# Markdown markup language

Markdown is lightweight markup language which is simple to use and
available in many programming language and applications. It's an easy
way to renders HTML pages. 

What is frustrating when using markdown is that there is many *variant* or *flavors* [^ref2]. 
John Gruber canonical specification[^ref1] contains many ambiguities,
and it seems to have generated various markdown specific syntax and
parsers.

Here's cheatsheats of variants I use:
- [Basic syntax](../41)
- [Commonmark]
- [GitHub flavored markdown]
