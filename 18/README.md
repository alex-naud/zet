# Tree, forest and dendrogram

A **tree** is simply an undirected connected graph in which all pairs of
vertices are connected by exactly one path. By extension, a **forest**
is a graph were all connected components are trees.

Visualy, tree can be represented as **dendrogram** where the root is on
one side and the leaf are on the other side. Generaly we have a top down
representation.

The name derives from two ancient greek words, [δένδρον](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek "wikt:δένδρον")(*déndron*), meaning "tree", and [γράμμα](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek "wikt:γράμμα")(*grámma*), meaning "drawing, mathematical figure".
