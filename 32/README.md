# Hierarchical agglomerative clustering

Agglomerative hierarchical methods start with $n$ clusters, where $n$ is the number of objects, and fuse them sequentially at different partition level, 
namely a distance treshold at which fusion happens. This treshold increase from 0 to 1.

Agglomerative hierarchical cluster includes the following category of methods:
- [Objects-linkage](../28)
- Average clustering
- Ward's minimum variance

See this post on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-hierarchical-clustering-python) for a nice introduction on hierarchical agglomerative methods.

See this [note](../33) on the visual representation of hierarchical clusters
using dendrogram, graphs and cophenetic matrix.
