# Clustering validation

Evaluate validity of a clustering solution is not an easy task, but an
important one considering that:

- Clustering algorithms will give rise to partition wether or not the uderlying data pertain to different cluster.
- Different algorithm will provide different results based on the uderlying assumption about cluster "shape"
- Different methods are variously sensitive to noise

Consquently clustering validity assessment will help answers the
following questions:
- Is the cluster are *real* of simply an artefact of the underlying algorithm?
- Is the cluster results best fits the underlying data?

Here are categories of **Validation measures**:
1. Internal criteria
2. External criteria
3. Relative criteria
