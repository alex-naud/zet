# Distance

Measure of separation between two objects. It takes the maximum values
if the two objects are completely different, and a value of 0 if they
are identical. *Distance* and *Dissimilarities* are often used interchangeably,
although they can mean different [things](../4).

See Section 7.4 in Legender and Legender (2012)[^Legendre] for an
exhaustive review of distance coefficients.
