# Similarity and distance

#statistical-association

Similarities are measures of *likeness* between objects. 
Inversely, dissimilarities are measure of *separation* between objects.

*Distance* and *Dissimilarities* are often used interchangeably,
although they can mean different [things](../16).

When having normalized coefficients that range in $[0, 1]$, we can
easily get corresponding coefficients.

$$D = 1 - S, \quad D = \sqrt(1 - S), \quad D = \sqrt(1 - S^2)$$[^Equation]

See Section 7.3 and 7.4 in Legender and Legender (2012)[^Legendre] for an
exhaustive review of simmilarities/dissimilarities coefficients.
