# Statistical association

Association is a loosed term to describe the *ressemblance* between a set of objects or descriptors.  
These includes **dependance** (or correlation) coefficients between descriptors, such as Pearson's product moment or Spearman's rank coefficients, 
but also **distance** and **similarity** codefficients which describe ressemblance between objects.

This duality between object and descriptor associations is described as
Q and R analyses in Legendre and Legendre (2012) on Ecological
ressemblance[^Legendre].
